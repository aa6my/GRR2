	            <h5>About Lyssna</h5>
				Welcome to Lyssna, the definitive source for reviews and information on the video game industry. Here's what you'll be pointing your eyeballs at: video game reviews and information, 
				the latest game trailer, reviews and information, all presented with as much excitement, enthusiasm, insight and fun as the laws of physics allow. But don't think that lighthearted jabs 
				and an irreverent tone signals the end of serious business: Lyssna strives to maintain accuracy, to dig deeper, to do away with meaningless PR prattle, to gracefully decline luxury popcorn machines 
				(like in the movie theater!), and to ask the awkward questions, all for you.
